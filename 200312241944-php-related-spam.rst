I was surprised to see PHP related SPAM. Today my mailbox received this mail (links are mangled so that the site doesn't get
more hits through search engines).

It makes me wonder how this person got his PhD, especially when you
know what this product does. (And no, it's not up to par with
either `Zend's`_ SafeGuard Suite or `IonCube's`_ encoders.
(Actually, even `APE`_ has a
much better 'encoding').
