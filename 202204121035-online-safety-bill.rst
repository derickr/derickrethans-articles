There is currently a `bill <https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137>`_ going
through the UK's parliament, titled the "Online Safety Bill". It is a far
going piece of legislation with countless stifling effects. I have written the
following letter to my MP, Tulip Siddiq. Please feel free to use this as a
template when you write to your own MP about this topic.

Dear Tulip Siddiq MP,

In the last several years I have been following the various different versions
of the UK's new Online Safety Bill, and have grave concerns. It is a
far-reaching bill that fundamentally changes the UK's approach to the
internet, including the suppression of speech.

I have been working with internet related things for nearly 25 years now, and
I can see massive things wrong with the big tech platforms, most notably the
proliferation and promotion of disinformation which has put a dent in the
trust in science and research, including new vaccines, and politics.

However, the bill does not only apply to the big tech firms (Facebook, Google,
Twitter, etc.), but to all sites with user generated content. And there is
virtually nobody talking about anything besides just Facebook, to be honest.

With this letter I would like to highlight a few of the larger problems with
this bill, when applied to smaller sites with user generated content. If the
current draft bill becomes law, then these smaller sites and businesses would
come under severe duress, and might have to close to UK citizens, or fully.

I would like to introduce two examples here, with which I have direct
involvement.

In the past 6 years I have written, maintained, and hosted `Dram.io
<https://dram.io>`_. It is a website where users can keep notes about which
whiskies they like, with tasting notes and photos. It is primarily used by me
and a few friends, and has around a dozen active users. It is open to the
public, but most definitely a niche site. It does not promote anything, but it
does talk about adult content (alcohol).

In the past 20+ years I have been an active contributor to PHP
(https://www.php.net), a computer language that powers more than 75% [#]_ of
all the websites on the internet, including (through WordPress) your own,
http://tulipsiddiq.com. The PHP language is a volunteer project and organises
itself primarily through asynchronous communication methods such as e-mail
lists and on-line chat rooms, which are all open to the public to read and
write to. These are also user-generated content sites that the bill captures.

The Online Safety Bill (OSB) is a complex bill, with many provisions. It
almost feels like every pressure group has their own personal agenda. Let me
discuss a few of these with the above two projects in mind.

First of all, the OSB has provisions about "legal but harmful"
content, argued by the bill's proponents to "protect the
children". This is content that is not illegal, but could be considered
harmful to other people. The bill does not define clearly what harmful is, and
leaves this definition to the regulator (OFCOM), at the whims of the culture
secretary (currently, Nadine Dorries). Although the bill's proponents
often argue that when something is illegal off-line, it should also be illegal
on-line, the provisions in the bill go further. The definition of harmful is
so wide that basically any content that could be seen as harmful to anybody
else, is liable for content control (i.e., removal, or tagged as such). 

Checking for this content requires active moderation. Active moderation on a
large scale, such as with Facebook, is hard to do because there is so much
content created that it is impossible to do by humans. I would argue that it
is also impossible to do through automation. Although algorithms can be
constructed to aid in this, they will never be able to be accurate enough to:

1. Flag or block all possible harmful content;
2. Not flag or block non-harmful content. (Example: the ban by TikTok of
   "Charles Dickens" [#]_ because it has a naughty word in it).

In the chat rooms and mailing lists of the PHP Open Source project a lot of
content is generated every day. This can not realistically be pre-cleared by
moderators. Doing so is not wanted either. It is a large international project
where developers should be able to speak their mind. At times, it certainly
gets heated, and red lines get crossed sometimes, including in the form of
personal attacks. Although this hampers the technical discussions, the PHP
project should be in charge to regulate their community, and not OFCON, and
certainly not minister Dorries. The discussion platforms that the PHP project
uses will fall under the provisions of the OSB. In order to not fall foul of a
law, it can be easily argued by the PHP project's leadership that it is
not worth opening themselves up to the punishments as set out in the OSB. A
likely scenario could be that they decide that the easiest way around it would
be to block UK residents and locations from being able to participate. This in
turn will dampen innovation, and also directly affects my livelihood, and
negatively affects the internet industry in the UK.

For sites such as my hobby project, Dram.io, which sees little content added,
I could review all content personally. Because it deals with commentary about
alcohol products, it can be argued that no children should ever see this
content (harmful, but legal), and that it should therefore be limited to
visitors aged 18 and older, which brings me to the next point.

The bill includes provisions to require age verification for any harmful (to
children) content. Age verification is usually done by checking against a
credit card or uploading a passport, or something similar. Either to a site
directly, or through a third party provider. Large(r) sites such as Facebook
can spend time and money to create something for themselves, albeit at a cost.
A small site such as my personal project Dram.io does not have the money, or
does not want to spend money, on setting up that infrastructure. They would
have to use a third party to provide these age verification checks to comply
with this provision, at a cost. Many large international Open Source projects
such as the PHP language don't even have any money to spend on this, as
it is run by volunteers.

This would likely mean that I would have to close down Dram.io to not be
caught up by the OSB. And the PHP project might *have* to decide to not allow
British citizens and residents to participate in discussions again.

There is also a problem with these third party providers with regards to
security. Many adult entertainment businesses are on the front line to provide
these services, as they're well placed to provide this (they had to
historically). They also have been keenly lobbying the authors of the bill to
include age verification requirements as this adds to their bottom line. Do we
really want adult entertainment businesses to hold our credit card numbers, or
even worse, our personal passport details? I would find this too much of a
security risk. Personally, I have no intention to provide any of my own
details to third party age verification providers. It is even up to OFCON to
"certify" verification check systems for use.

There are two more issues that are a little harder to describe, and are more
legal changes. First of all, the bill changes the liability of the content
(cat videos, comments about news articles) that is being generated. Currently,
many sites benefit from provisions in the Defamation Act 2013 [#]_ that posted
content by users does not create liability by the publication (website) that
publishes this content. The OSB changes this by making the publishers
(websites) liable for what their users post. Although it can be reasonably
argued that website's (read: Facebook's) promotion algorithms
*should* be held liable for the items it suggests (as that is not user
generated content), making publishers liable for what their users post goes
much further.

The bill also tries to redefine the different meaning of Duty of
Care [#]_, a mechanism in Tort law where companies can be held liable for
negligence. The bill redefines as Duty of Care from just between company
(publisher) and their customers (content generating users), to also include
the interactions between their customers (people writing whisky tasting notes,
or technical arguments for including or not, features in the PHP languages).
By introducing such a liability, website operators will be forced to be on the
safe side, and likely over block and prematurely remove (legal) content, to not
fall foul of these provisions. Or if they don't have the resources to
screen for such content they might decide that it is not worth it to continue
serving Brits. Again, that won't probably be companies the size of
Facebook, but it's going to be detrimental to smaller projects.

Lastly, the bill does make provisions for journalistic and editorial content,
but does not clearly define what journalistic content is as part of a
"regulated news publisher" (see Section 16 (8, 14), Section 49 and
50). It is probably clear that websites such as the Guardian and Telegraph
will fall in this category, but unlikely that websites such as Wembley Matters
[#]_ are, even though they do provide a democratic task to hold politicians to
account. Not having exceptions for this kind of journalistic expression is
again limiting rights.

I hope by writing this letter that I have highlighted some of the problems
that I see with this bill. There is a large
possibility for the restriction of expression, both by being unclear what
journalistic content is, but also requiring pretty much every website that
allows for user generated content to have to be a lot more restrictive of what
they can allow to be posted. Even though this content is legal, the extra
burdens being put on smaller operators are of such chilling nature that we
will very likely see them having to be closed, or not being made available to
British citizens. I would hate to see this being the collateral damage from
this huge and not well thought out bill.

With kind regards,
Derick Rethans
