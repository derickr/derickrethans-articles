Today, at the longest day of the year at the `summer solstice`_ , I am
making a bit change to my life. If you're following me on twitter you probably already
know what I'm up to. For everybody else, I am going to say good bye to
Skien in Norway, and move to London (the one in England, and not the one
in Ontario). Norway has been my home for the past five years, and I've
had a great time exploring the nature as well as working at `our`_ office in `Skien`_ . Skien is a nice
place, but ... not the most interesting of cities in the world. From
today I will be living in London to see what life will bring me there. I
am both sad to leave Norway, but I am also excited to live in a cool new
place like London. I'll have awesome house mates (Hi, Mr.
Þorbjörnsson, Ms. Cherry and Mr. Ray!!), and something new to put my
energy in. I will continue to work as project leader for `eZ Components`_ for `eZ Systems`_ and continue to make great software
with Alexandru, `Tobias`_ , `Kore`_ and `Sebastian`_ . If you are about
in London, let me know! We could go for a pint or something. See you
there!
