This
second (and hopefully last) Release Candidate comes just before
Christmas as some form of present I guess. There are not many new things
in this version but there are lots of bug fixes. The display of stack
traces has been optimized a bit more, you can find a screen shot of that
here below. Instead of showing the full path and function arguments it
instead shows only the file name, and the type of argument. If you hover
your mouse of the items the full path and full variables' contents
appear.
