Het Schilderij (The Painting) is a gastropub in the small village of Dieren,
where I grew up. The pub has been around for as long as I can remember, and
I've had many a merry evening there in my youth. But it has evolved, and now
has the feel of an English Gastropub, with a decent (although hardly changing)
menu, with seasonal additions. They also have a great selection of interesting
beers. It is a spot we frequently eat in as well, when we visit my parents.

In that context, we found ourselves here on a cold and rainy autumn evening.
As a starter we shared an "Oerbrood", a rustic loaf, with butter, (very
garlicky) butter, and some tapenade which worked well with a glass of Hertog
Jan's Grand Prestige beer. 

In autumn, it is quite common to see game on restaurant menus, and Het
Schilderij is no exception. My wife and I both selected the venison steak,
served with a thick wine jus. The venison was still moist and a little pink in
the middle, with a nice grill-seared outside — adding a bit of colour and
flavour. My parents both had wild boar loin which looked similarly delicious. 

Accompaniments are shared with the table, and the chips, pan fried potatoes,
and brussels sprouts with lardons (a seasonal addition) worked very well with
our choices. Although the sprouts aren't everyone's favourite, I thought they
were cooked just right.

We had a lovely evening, with enjoyable food and drink in a good atmosphere.
We'll certainly be back.
