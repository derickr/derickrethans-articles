In the beginning of this month I attended the `PHP Conference Brasil`_ . Besides speaking on `Xdebug`_ and the `eZ Components`_ I also spend a few
extra days as holiday there.

During those extra days I flew to Foz do Iguaçu to have a look at the `Itaipu dam`_ on the border with Paraguay and `Iguaçu falls`_ .

Besides the falls there are many other things to see in the park, such
as `butterflies`_ and very big ants.

After visiting the park I travelled further south to visit one of my
colleagues, Melissa.
Together we travelled to Gramado, a very German `looking city`_ .

For the rest of the pictures check my `gallery`_ . There
are also a few panoramas available.
