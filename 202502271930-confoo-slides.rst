I have been speaking at the 2025 edition of `ConFoo
<https://confoo.ca/en/2025>`_ in Montreal, the city with three seasons in as
many days.

I have given two talks.

- In `What's New in PHP 8.4? <https://derickrethans.nl/talks/php-confoo25>`_
  I explain the major new features of PHP's most recent release, 8.4.
- And in `Better Debugging with Xdebug
  <https://derickrethans.nl/talks/xdebug-confoo25>`_ I explained some of
  Xdebug's new features, and also showed how to use some of these features to
  use the debugging in complicated situation. I also mentioned the `Native
  Path Mappings <https://xdebug.org/funding/001-native-path-mapping>`_ feature
  that I am working on, as well as the initial ideas and plans for time
  travelling.

Let me know if you have questions or comments.
