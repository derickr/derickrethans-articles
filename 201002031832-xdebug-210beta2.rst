I've just released Xdebug 2.1.0beta2 which features a few small bug fixes only.
With this release the Windows 5.3/VC6 binaries also return. 

One of the bug fixes is in a new feature that allows you to configure that the
debugger should connect back to the IDE running on the machine that initiated
the HTTP request. This feature, that originally was contributed by Lucas Nealan
and Brian Shire of Facebook, allows more easy use of multiple IDEs (users)
working on the same code base. In order to enable this, set
`xdebug.remote_connect_back`_ to 1. See the documentation for more information.

Of course, this feature should only be enabled if *nobody* besides authorized
developers can access the machine on which the xdebug.remote_connect_back
callback feature has been enabled. Instead of enabling this setting, you can
also support multiple developers through the proxy functionality that the DBGp
protocol supports. For more information on that, see `Debugging with multiple
users`_.

You can find the full changelog here_ and get the latest version from the
`download page`_.
