Everybody who thinks that the Santy.A worm uses one of the security problems addressed in PHP's latest `bugfix releases`_ is wrong. It was `NOT`_ due to any bug in PHP, but merely a badly
checked input variable which was passed to preg with the /e modifier. Besides this, phpBB is `also vulnarable`_ for some of the things
address by PHP's new releases. But they are wrong saying that it is not their fault. `Not-checked usage of serialized data`_ is still their problem. Short version: use `FUDforum`_ .
