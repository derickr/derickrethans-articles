Now that I am on the way back home, I finally have access to a decent
network again, without a proxy that converts all the JPEGs it can find
to GIFs - sigh.

Anyway, the slides for my two presentations - PHP's Secrets, about PHP's
internals, and Test Driven Development - as well as my keynote session
"Personal Home Page Tools Grown Up" are now available for
download at my `talks`_ page.
