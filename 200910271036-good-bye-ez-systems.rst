During the past 6 years I've been working as a developer for `eZ Systems`_ — first as a developer on eZ
Publish and later as project lead for `eZ Components`_. Working on a project
like `eZ Components`_ as lead was
challenging and interesting and taught me many things. `eZ Systems`_ as a company is changing a lot, and
now the time has come for me to move on and find something new and
exciting to do. I've recently `moved to London`_ to
explore life from a different point of view, and that will now also
include a search for a new challenge professionally. I will still be
with eZ Systems for awhile longer to finish the next `eZ Components`_ release. If you think
you can provide me with a new challenge, feel free to contact `me`_.
