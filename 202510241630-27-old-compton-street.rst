27 Old Compton Street is a restaurant close to Shaftesbury Avenue. It sits
among the busy streets of SOHO, it is hip, and it focusses on pasta.

I had the Pumpkin Ravioli, and my husband the Cacio e Pepe Bucatini. We
thought the dishes to be lovely, but in our opinion the pasta was a little too
al dente for us — another 30 seconds in the pan, and it would have been
perfect.

We followed with a portion to share of their only dessert, a pistachio sweet
gnocchi — these were little gnocchi sized doughnuts with a liquid pistachio
filling with a scoop of ice-cream and some crushed and chopped pistachios
(mind the inevitable squirt when you cut in).

Next time I'd have the courgette fries too which the table next to us had and
looked great.

We were in and out in about 45 minutes.
