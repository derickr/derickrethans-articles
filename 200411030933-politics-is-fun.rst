There were three people on an airplane. One was Thomas Jefferson.
One was George Bush. And the last was Bill Clinton. They opened up
the airplane door and Thomas Jefferson threw out a 100 dollar bill
and said "I just saved a family!" George Bush looked at Jefferson
and then threw out 2 100 dollar bills. He then said, "I just saved
TWO families!" Bill Clinton looked at Thomas Jefferson then at
George. He sighed and pushed George Bush off the plane and said "I
just saved the world!"
