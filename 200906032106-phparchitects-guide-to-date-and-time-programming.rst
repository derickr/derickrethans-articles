In the past year I've
been working on a book, describing PHP's Date and Time functionality in
great detail. It's now finally out under the name " `php|architect's Guide to Date and Time Programming`_ ". Look at the pretty cover! It's actually a
picture I took some months ago from the church in `Skien`_ , where I am *still* living (more about that in a later post).

The book is devoted on helping you understanding dates and times, as
well as how PHP deals with it. It explains how PHP parsers and reads
dates and times in strings including possible pitfalls; timezones, their
history, the annoyances and how to deal with them properly; formatting
and displaying dates and times; and last but not least, how to handle
intervals and iterating over time. There is more information on the `website`_ where
you can also buy this awesome book. And in case you're wondering
"what? dates and times are really simple!", then this book is *definitely* for you.

Rumour is that all attendees of the `Dutch PHP Conference`_ will receive a
copy with their tickets, if you're asking nicely I might even sign your
copy! I'll be there to give a talk on "PHP on the D-BUS" and
will show you how to talk to skype, GSM chips and other desktoppy
things!
