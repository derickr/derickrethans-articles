I spend last Saturday helping out HOT, the `Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team`_,
to improve the map of Lubumbashi, Congo. This session focussed on digitizing the
data that was acquired on the ground by volunteers.

But this was not where the effort started. It started a few weeks ago when
Jorieke_ set off to Lubumbashi to organise the mapping party. You can read more
about this on the `HOT blog`_.

In cooperation with `Doctors without Borders`_/Médecins Sans Frontières UK (MSF
UK), HOT organised this mapping effort. With help by students from the
University of Lubumbashi, they idea is to map the whole or at least as much as
possible of the city of Lubumbashi. 

At the start of the Mapathon_, `Harry Wood`_ went through his usual spiel of
introducing OpenStreetMap to the crowd. I dropped in the moment he was done.
Just in time to hear `Ivan Gayton`_'s talk on the work of MSF and their Congo
mapping work. Mapping in Congo is not nearly as simple as it is here, where
streets have street names that are neatly printed on street signs. This is not
the case in Congo. There no street signs and often, people use names that are
either not official, or have no official name anyway. The only way to find out
how streets are called, is by asking the people living there!

MSF is interested in street name information, or more precisely, the
neighbourhood names so that they have an identifier for statistical analysis
for epidemiology. The accurate location names allows them to pinpoint for
example cholera outbreaks, and hopefully in the future they can take
preventative action against disease outbreaks.

The first step was creating a basic road layout, which was handled by a
`Mapathon in Berlin`_. Coordination of such large mapping efforts happen
through the `OSM Tasking Manager`_. You can see the job for Lubumbashi at
http://tasks.hotosm.org/job/456 They did not stop at Lubumbashi though, and
traced a whole of of other towns as well. And the mapping was not only
remotely done from Berlin, but OpenStreetMap communities from Hungary_, Togo_,
Burkina_ helped as well—a true global community.

Besides this initial road tracing job, there are a few other things still to
trace too. If you have time, give them a hand for
http://tasks.hotosm.org/job/459

With a basic road layout traced from areal images you have a rough idea on
how a city looks like, but nothing beats a survey on the ground to see how
things actually are. It is not always easy to spot things on areal imagery.

While remote mapping parties were nearing their completion of the road
network, a group of volunteers from Department of Geography of the University
of Lubumbashi went out into the neighbourhoods with FieldPapers_ to do the
survey. Through hints from Ivan I understood that it took MSF some time to
convince their professor to help out for free. He could hardly believe that
some organisation was collecting all this data and then making it available
for free. Not just for "no money", but also under an open license. Perhaps he
was worried about what Google MapMaker_ is trying to do in underdeveloped
countries—getting volunteers to collect data for them and then locking it up
in GoogleMaps. Having open access to the data is of course much more valuable.

FieldPapers allows you to create atlases_ of areas. It divides this up into
bite size chunks so that you can print them out and mark your survey
information on the paper. For the Lubumbashi mapthon, we had an immense stack
of those FieldPapers with notes on them. And our task was to go through this
stack and digitize the notes on the map through an OpenStreetMap editor, such
as JOSM. I think I managed to go through about 100 to 150 pages of them during
the mapathon. One of the areas_ that I did was about 30 sheets of paper!

In the end, we made it through all of the FieldPapers. Task completed! But
that does not mean we're finished. This effort was only a small section of
Lubumbashi and the local volunteers are going to continue their effort. But
they are also learning how to edit the data themselves. And that is the only
sustainable way, but I will try to help out whenever I can!
