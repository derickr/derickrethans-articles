MTU

   :Where: Dieren, The Netherlands

Since a week or so I have an ADSL connection by `XS4ALL`_ because I was so sick
of having too much trouble with my cable connection. The installation went
pretty fast and everything worked fine after (ab)using an extra DSL splitter as
inline low-band filter for another telephone in the house. This is not really
supported, but it works quite fine as described `here`_.

There was one problem that I couldn't figure out though. Some sites,
including my Internet banking, a TV Guide site and the service site of
XS4ALL where unable to show me any reply to my HTTP requests. I could
see with tcpdump that the three way handshake worked fine, but after
that no data came back to me (some information has been removed to
make it look better on the site):

::
	
	:22.073702 kossu.41688 > website.http:
		S 4228908137:4228908137(0) win 5840
	:22.106315 website.http > kossu.41688:
		S 2750130311:2750130311(0) ack 4228908138 win 5792 (DF)
	:22.107974 kossu.41688 > website.http:
		. ack 1 win 5840
	:22.109591 kossu.41688 > website.http:

	:22.110054 kossu.41688 > website.http:
		P 501:548(47) ack 1 win 5840
	:22.339458 kossu.41688 > website.http:

	:22.799424 kossu.41688 > website.http:
		. 1:501(500) ack 1 win 5840


But then after a tip from Stefan Esser, which told me that it could
be a problem with the MTA or something and other sites totally
disabling ICMP to negotiate a new MTU, I found something interesting
in the output of tcpdump:

::
	
	:25.559806 fw > kossu: icmp:
		website unreachable - need to frag (mtu 500) [tos 0xc0]


I was wondering why the hell the MTU would be "500" as the default
for Ethernet is 1500 iirc. Then I remembered that I changed this a
couple of weeks before because of problems with my Chelloween
connection and apparently I forgot to change it back. Issuing
"ifconfig eth0 mtu 1500" made everything work perfect again so I can
finally enjoy the full power ofmy DSL line.
