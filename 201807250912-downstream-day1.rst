I have started walking the whole length of the `Thames Path`_. 184 miles from
the source_ to the `Thames Barrier`_. While walking it, I'm making a little
documentary, "Downstream", of which the first episode is here:

It's my first ever attempt at doing something like this, and hence, **very**
rough. It covers the first day out of a three day long walking trip, and I
will be adding further episodes of this segments, and then further walking
trips in the future.

Enjoy!
