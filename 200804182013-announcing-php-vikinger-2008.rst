The `PHP Vikinger`_ unconference
will be held for the third year in `Skien, Norway`_ . Just like
previous years it follows directly after `eZ Systems`_  `conference`_ which
puts this year's `PHP Vikinger`_ on June 21st, the longest day of the year.

Flickr features some pictures from `previous years`_ . And `PHP Norge`_ has a report
from `last year`_ . Let me know
(through the e-mail on the `PHP Vikinger`_ website) if you're interested, and if you want to suggest
topics.
