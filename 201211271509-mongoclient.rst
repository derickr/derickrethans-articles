This afternoon we published_ version 1.3.0 of the MongoDB PHP driver.
Besides a number of bug fixes
since RC2 and RC3, this new release also includes a new ``MongoClient`` class.
This new MongoClient_ class serves as a replacement for the 
``Mongo`` class. The old ``Mongo`` class is now deprecated and will be
removed in a future release, although we are keeping it in place for now
because of backwards compatibility reasons. We have already removed it mostly from the
documentation, and are working to update all our other material as well.

All of the other MongoDB_ drivers are making a similar change.

Now, you may be wondering why we are replacing ``Mongo`` with ``MongoClient``
across the board.  The biggest reason is that the new class will have
**acknowledged** writes on by default—or expressed in deprecated wording:
**MongoClient has safe mode on by default**. We are moving away from the word
*safe* though, mainly because the definition of the word has very little to
do with its meaning in the MongoDB context.  Your data is perfectly safe without
safe mode on as well (in fact, that is what journaling is for). The *safe*
option determined whether or not the driver would wait for the MongoDB server
to acknowledge a write operation.

Together with the addition of the ``MongoClient`` class we will
deprecate the *safe* option to methods handling writes, such as
MongoCollection::`insert()`_, MongoCollection::`update()`_, and others. We do
provide a new way of controlling how the driver waits for the server
to acknowledge writes (or not). The connection string now supports the
``w`` option, which you can use as shown in the following examples:

 - Turning off acknowledged writes:

   ``$m = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost/?w=0');``

 - Turning on acknowledged writes (the default): 

   ``$m = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost/?w=1');``

 - Turning on replica set acknowledged writes:

   ``$m = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost/?w=2');``

Setting ``w`` in the connection strings makes that the default *write
concern* for any write operation. You can of course override this per
write operation as well, by specifying the ``w`` option::

	<?php
	$m = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost/');
	/* By default writes are now acknowledged */
	$m->demoDb->collection->insert(
		[ 'client' => 'awesome' ], // ← document
		[ 'w' => 0 ]  // ← don't acknowledge writes for this insert
	);
	?>

If the server acknowledges that the write operation could *not* succeed,
for example when you have a duplicate ``_id`` key violation, then the
driver will throw a `MongoCursorException`_. The driver uses
acknowledged writes by default with ``MongoClient``, which means you are
required to handle the cases where the write did not succeed and the
exception is thrown::

	<?php
	$m = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost/');
	try
	{
		$m->demoDb->collection->insert( [ '_id' => 'awesome' ]);
	}
	catch ( MongoCursorException $e )
	{
		echo $e->getCode(), ': ', $e->getMessage(), "\n";
	}
	?>

You can either retry the write yourself, or not, depending on the reason
why the write did not succeed. In case of a duplicate key violation, you
probably do not want to retry. In case a connection could not be made,
you probably do want to retry (after a certain timeout).

So to repeat our major change:
**The new MongoClient class uses acknowledged writes by default**.
