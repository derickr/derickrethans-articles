It seems that it is still hard to work with email programs. I do
not understand why it is so hard to use "reply-all" (standard in
most sane mail clients) when discussing things on a public
mailinglist such as PHP's. Although I reply to mails directed at
webmaster@php.net, that doesn't mean I'm the only one...
