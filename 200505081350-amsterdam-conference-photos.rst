As I `wrote a week ago`_ I've been
attending and speaking on the International PHP Conference in Amsterdam.
During the conference we spend some time in the city too, where I shot a
couple of pictures together with `Andrei`_ . You can find the full album `here`_ .
There are no picture of the conference venue itself though.
