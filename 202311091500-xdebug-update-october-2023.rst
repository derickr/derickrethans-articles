In this monthly update I explain what happened with Xdebug development
in the past month. These are normally published on the first
Tuesday on or after the 5th of each month.

`Patreon <https://www.patreon.com/derickr>`_ and `GitHub
<https://github.com/sponsors/derickr/>`_ supporters will get it earlier,
around the first of each month.

You can `become a patron <https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=7864328>`_
or support me through `GitHub Sponsors
<https://github.com/sponsors/derickr>`_. I am currently 35% towards my $2,500
per month goal, which is set to allow continued maintenance of Xdebug.

If you are leading a team or company, then it is also possible to
support Xdebug through `a subscription <https://xdebug.org/support>`_.

In the last month, I spend around 32 hours on Xdebug, with 25 hours funded.

Towards Xdebug 3.3
------------------

In `last month's update
</xdebug-update-september-2023.html#towards_xdebug_3_3>`_ I explained that I
was investigating whether Xdebug can make use of PHP's Observer API. It turns
out that it can be used to intercept function calls, but
only ``include`` or ``require`` calls if the included files contain code, and
not just class definitions. As Xdebug treats ``include`` and friends as actual
function calls, I can unfortunately not solely rely on the Observer API.

In the wake of checking out the Observer API, I also thought I should have a
look at some performance improvements. For example, I noticed that Xdebug
would always collect local variables with each function call. This is only
really needed when showing local variables, in stack traces, or through the
step debugger.

Another optimisation that I worked on was to optimise the way how function
breakpoints are checked against. These breakpoints trigger when a function
gets called, or returned from. This is not a feature that many people often
use, but Xdebug would always do some work to be able to compare the configured
breakpoints against a normalised function name reference.

These two optimisations together resulted in a 20% reduction in CPU
instructions (roughly equivalent to execution time) with the front page of
WordPress' demo site.

The third optimisation that I worked is related to file/line breakpoints. Xdebug
would evaluate whether an IDE has set a line breakpoint on the
current line. For this, it had to loop over all the existing breakpoints and
compare them. Each additional breakpoint would be checked after every
statement, meaning that the number of breakpoints affected the running time of
the script.

My optimisation alleviates this by moving the check on whether line
breakpoints exist for a function or method to the function call itself. If no
breakpoints are set in the whole function, then Xdebug skips the check for
line breakpoints after each statement. This shifts the factor of performance
loss for having line breakpoints from the **number of statements** to the
**number of function calls**. This shift results in a roughly 25% performance
boost with only four line breakpoints enabled.

After attending IPC and speaking to fellow Xdebug users, a question came up
about long running scripts. Right now, Xdebug's step debugger can only be
activated when the script starts or by calling `xdebug_connect_to_client()
<https://xdebug.org/docs/all_functions#xdebug_connect_to_client>`_.
Breakpoints can also only be configured when Xdebug is waiting for a command to
continue a script (after a step, an existing breakpoint, or at the
start of the script). While a script is running, you can not interrupt the
execution to break, or add new breakpoints.

This let me to experiment with a control socket, currently only available on
Linux. Through this socket you can then ask Xdebug for information, or request
a breakpoint so that you can then use your IDE to add more breakpoints, or
inspect the current state.

At the moment, I have implemented the "show me some information" feature,
which allows me to show the running PHP scripts, with PID, memory usage (in
kb), running time, and Xdebug version. The ``xdebug`` command line tool allows
you to control Xdebug through the socket:

I have not merged this feature yet, but I hope to do so once I have the
step debugger interruption feature as well.

Beyond this, I will continue to work on the features and issues on the `3.3
roadmap <https://bugs.xdebug.org/roadmap_page.php?version_id=101>`_, without
any guarantees these tickets will be implemented.

Xdebug Videos
-------------

I have not published any new videos in the last month, but I did record one. It
is set to premiere on November 7th. To get notified, you can subscribe to my
`YouTube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9Kjjye-m1g_eXpdaifUqLqALLqZqKd4>`_,
or follow `me <https://phpc.social/@derickr>`_ or `Xdebug
<https://phpc.social/@Xdebug>`_ on Mastodon.

Business Supporter Scheme and Funding
-------------------------------------

In the last month, no new business supporters signed up.

Besides business support, I also maintain a `Patreon
<https://www.patreon.com/derickr>`_ page, a profile on `GitHub sponsors
<https://github.com/sponsors/derickr>`_, as well as an `OpenCollective
<https://opencollective.com/xdebug>`_ organisation.

Xdebug Cloud
------------

Xdebug Cloud is the *Proxy As A Service* platform to allow for debugging
in more scenarios, where it is hard, or impossible, to have Xdebug make
a connection to the IDE. It is continuing to operate as Beta release.

Packages start at Â£49/month, and I have recently introduced a package
for larger companies. This has a larger initial set of tokens, and
discounted extra tokens.

If you want to be kept up to date with Xdebug Cloud, please sign up to
the `mailinglist <https://xdebug.cloud/newsletter>`_, which I will use
to send out an update not more than once a month.
