A few days ago I finally wandered into London with a tripod and my camera. I've
been meaning to do this for months and take long exposure shots of various
places in London, as well as seeing whether I can make cool timelapses.  I've
only taken a few pictures near the Thames and the London Eye so far, with one
timelapse of the London Eye. I am however planning to return for more. This
photography trip also coincided with the conjunction_ of Jupiter and Venus.

Here are some of the images:

This timelapse was recorded with 802 images. Each image is taken 3 seconds
after the previous one resulting in a speed-up of 75 times. Lighting has been
manually monitored during the taking of the images. 

The rest of the images are on flickr_.
