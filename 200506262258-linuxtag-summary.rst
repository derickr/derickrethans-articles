The trip back to Norway was luckily very uneventful - no delays and no
missing luggage. We can look back at LinuxTag now, after the `LAMP Day`_ on Thursday the rest of the
days were spend on manning the `eZ systems`_ booth. We met a great deal of interested people - even though there
seemed to have been less people attending LinuxTag than last year.
Besides visitors at the booth I had an excellent chat with the
publishers of the german translation of `PHP 5 Power Programming`_ .

A representative of the `Software Patents Group at the FFII`_ contact us and interested us to `visit Brussels`_ to talk to MEPs. If time permits Zak will go to Brussels next
Wednesday.

After the conference on Saturday Bård and I wanted to have some Indian
food - something that is very hard to get in Norway. We ended up at the `Taj Palace`_ on a ten minutes walk from the conference
fair.
