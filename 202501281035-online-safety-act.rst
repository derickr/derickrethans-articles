A few years ago I wrote a `letter to my then MP Tulip Siddiq
<https://derickrethans.nl/online-safety-bill.html>`_, with regard to the
Online Safety `bill <https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137>`_.

This bill has now become the `Online Safety Act
<https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/contents>`_ and the regulator,
`Ofcom <https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/>`_ is preparing the rules
and regulations around this.

What I then was worrying about, now all seems to come through. So I wrote the
following letter to my new MP `Georgia Gould
<https://members.parliament.uk/member/5305/contact>`_.

Dear Georgia Gould MP,

I wanted to write to you as my MP regarding the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA),
which was passed under the previous government with wide support from Labour.

Although it was always touted as promoting online safety, targeting the large
social media companies, it is currently already having serious unintended
consequences. 

Because it is not just the larger social media companies that are in scope,
but it also affects community forums, discussion groups about issues in Open
Source software, and small independent sites. In most cases, these are not
commercial entities making money from stirring up controversies, which is what
in my opinion the OSA should have focussed on.

Each platform that has some relation with user-to-user to content is in scope,
and the operators needs to a complicated risk assessment. Although Ofcon is
now coming out with some help [#]_, and they talk about "proportionality", I
would argue that many of these requirements are not proportional at all.

Personally, I would, need to do a risk assessment for several "services" (that
I have identified so far), none of which are commercial—there are not even
ads, algorithms, or tracking:

- The comments for my low-traffic blog (https://derickrethans.nl), as users
  can reply to comments by other users, and potentially add links to photos,
  even though all comments are pre-moderated.
- The issue tracker for one of my Open Source projects
  (https://bugs.xdebug.org). I self-host this, but
  users can submit bug reports, with screenshots showing where something went
  wrong.
- The web-based interfaces to the discussion groups of a large Open Source
  language project (PHP) (https://news-web.php.net/). This is a language used
  by upwards of 50% of the web. The groups are for discussing technical
  details of the language, but as it is user-to-user and not just e-mail, it
  is in scope.
- I help run a Mastodon server for the community of users for this language
  (https://phpc.social) as well, which is also clearly in scope.
- A small website that I, and a few other users, use for storing and sharing
  notes on whiskies we have tried (https://dram.io).

If I do any of these assessments wrong, or neglect to do, I would be liable,
perhaps with severe penalties. Some of those deal with images, others with
alcohol (so 18 and up). But none of them are probably high risk. But I still
have to this. And these 5 are just examples that affect *me*. And nothing
would stop malicious entities from making spurious complaints or uploads to
get me in trouble.

But it goes further, resources and communities grown over decades will be gone
because the consequences of enforcement under the OSA are so draconian that
anyone rightly concerned about their users and the law isn't going to take the
risk of that liability [#]_.

Ironically those who don't care about their users or UK law will just ignore
it and likely be beyond prosecution/enforcement anyway, while those who do
genuinely care about the actual safety would find it really hard and costly.

The worst about this is this will do is the opposite of the intentions of the
OSA, and consolidate power in the large companies, as small independent
operators shut their services down.

This is pretty much exactly the opposite of what we need right now.

We need diversity of online communities and opportunities for people to create
safe online spaces that are not subject to the whims of someone like Mark
Zuckerberg or Elon Musk.

As a matter of fact, there is already a list being compiled of services that
have decided to shut down, or block access to users from UK locations:
https://onlinesafetyact.co.uk/in_memoriam/ — I expect that list to grow
drastically over the next few months.

I hope you can urge the UK government to amend things and clarify the position
for small operators (some of which that have been part of the internet since
the earliest days), so the UK doesn't lose all the small, independent,
curated online communities, nor small independent non-UK companies blocking
access for UK users.

With kind regards,
Derick Rethans
