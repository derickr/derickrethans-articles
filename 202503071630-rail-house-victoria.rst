We went to the Rail House Victoria on a rainy Friday evening. We were seated
right next to a big group with children generally acting up, on a table which
if I’m honest was a little undersized.

We started our meal with five aged Gouda croquettes. We've seen portions of
two, three, and four before, but five is slightly bizarre. I don't get it when
restaurants serve sharing items in prime number portions. It makes it harder to
divide properly to share. They were however, quite tasty.

As her main, my wife selected the minute sirloin stack, which was served with a
fried egg with a running yolk, and a caper salsa. It was well cooked. I chose
the roast lamb, which was served with a fried rice with peppers and onions. The
lamb was spot on as well, and lovely pink in the middle. It however did come in
a very hot pan which I subsequently burned my hand on. With the meal, we shared
a bottle of a Cantina di Gambellare merlot. 

The dishes were fine, but the setting was more like an industrial gastropub,
than a date-night establishment.

We were finished pretty quickly,, but didn't fancy any of their puddings.
Instead, we popped over the road to Stoke House to enjoy a lovely cocktail.
