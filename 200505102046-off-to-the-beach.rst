Tomorrow I'll be flying to Canc√∫n, Mexico to speak at `php|tropics`_ . Not only will I
speak on three interesting subjects - Encryption with PHP, Clustering
PHP and MySQL and a Bring Your Own Laptop session on Debugging with `Xdebug`_ - I will also try to enjoy some of
the beautiful surroundings there. A (photo)trip to the Maya Ruins at
Chichen Itza sounds like a good plan too.
