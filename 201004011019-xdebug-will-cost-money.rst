**This was obviously an April Fools' joke, Xdebug will continue to stay
Open Source and free of charge.**

Later today I will be releasing the first Release Candidate of Xdebug 2.1.
With regret I have to announce that from this release, I will no longer provide
Xdebug as an open source debugger extension. I've noticed that there are other
projects making money of Xdebug's success while I only receive donations_ from a
group of awesome supporters.

Xdebug will continue to be available for benefactors on a limited number of
platforms that I have access to (Linux 32/64bit and Windows). Please refer to
the FAQ for further information.
