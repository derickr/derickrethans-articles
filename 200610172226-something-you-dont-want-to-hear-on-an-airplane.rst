When attempting to go home from a short holiday I had the
"luck" of a broken plane. After some 15 minutes they provided
us with a "reserve kist" (Dutch for "spare box")
that would take us back to Norway. 20 meter into the taxiing procedure
we suddenly stopped and were towed back to our parking spot. The captain
came on the intercom and said "We just had a computer crash, we'll
reboot it in somewhat the same way you reboot your Windows XP machine at
home." - Definitly not good :) (I did make it home alive though).
