We were not planning to go here, but due to unforeseen circumstances with our
planned dinner venue, we had to change plans at the last moment, and this pub
was close by.

It's a fairly typical Young's pub, with their standard taps, including a Real
Ale — the Young's Original. I ordered fish and chips, sorry, the "Ale Battered
Haddock". My partner ordered the bavette steak. The fish had a nice crispy
coating, and as a first for me, came with curry sauce as well as tartare
sauce. It worked better than I expected. The chips were a bit on the chewy
side, but then again, I like mine mega crunchy on the outside, and fluffy on
the inside — like good fries should be!

The portions were large, and we were properly full by the end. I have to admit
I was struggling a little.

It got busy soon after we finished our meal and was a little too loud and
shouty for my liking. Therefore, we made a swift exit and headed home.
