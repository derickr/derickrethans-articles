Brother Marcus has a few different locations. The one we visited is right
beside South Kensington station. It's a light filled comfy restaurant,
specialising in middle eastern style sharing platters.

We like eating on the earlier side, which meant that we could benefit from the
"pre-show set menu". This consists of a "rip and dip platter", consisting of
three dips, olives, and fluffy pittas; and then a veggie and meat mezze per
person.

The dips platter arrived swiftly, with our choice of roasted beetroot hummus,
baba ghanoush and taramasalata. All the dips were delicious, and the pittas
were indeed fluffy. A bottle of Kokotos wine showed up soon after, although I
probably should put bottle in double quotes, as it was filled from a tap. That
didn't do anything against its tastiness though.

As is usual in restaurants like this, everything comes when it's ready, so our
table was soon overflowing with dishes. The pan-fried halloumi was sweet and
sticky with a watermelon jam. The crispy aubergine skewer, crispy, but not dry
and served with a creamy labneh sprinkled with grape molasses. The calamari
had a well-seasoned coating, and was served with a green aioli. A little
sprinkling of chilli added a little kick. And finally, the moist and
well-spiced lamb koftas came on a smooth bed of aubergine begendi (béchamel
sauce).

Close to many of London's top museums, the pre-show menu was excellent value
at £25 per person. We can recommend this modern place, which after a day out
shuffling around old museum pieces will certainly fill your belly.
