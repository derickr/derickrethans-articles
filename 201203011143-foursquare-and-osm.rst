Yesterday, FourSquare announced_ that they are "joining the OpenStreetMap
movement", meaning that the now use OpenStreetMap_ data for their map tiles.
With their own map styles and using MapBox_ for rendering their styles.
This is **amazing** news I think.

Of course, as with many changes, some people are happy_ but there are others
that complain_ that the map data just isn't up to standards yet for their area.
That's a fair point as OpenStreetMap does not have all roads and
points-of-interest (POIs) of every city and town in the whole world. The
geographical data has mostly been contributed by people on the ground with GPS
devices through so called `mapping parties`_. Both in places like London_ as
well as in slums such as Kibera_. For a look at the progress over such a weekend,
check this video_ or have a look at `"OpenStreetMap: A Year of Edits"`_ for
an animation showing all the edits in 2011.

Foursquare is all about spamming twitter, I mean, checking into venues
to acquire points and badges. OpenStreetMap is all about having a database
of geographical data, and that is not only roads! I've written on OpenStreetMap
before_.

A venue is a POI in the OpenStreetMap jargon. It makes a whole lot of sense to
keep only one database of these POIs/venues. The venues are added (and fixed)
by foursquare users in the first place so getting that data into OpenStreetMap
would be awesome.

I think this is a great opportunity for fourquare to contribute the
venue data to improve OpenStreetMap. I think in this case, there needs to be
some form of review process before they can be added to OpenStreetMap, or
perhaps consolidated with already existing POI data. This is going be an
interesting challenge, and luckily foursquare already is toying_ with how to
improve OpenStreetMap's data.

Besides venues, OpenStreetMap also contains roads and in places those roads are
missing or don't have names. Perhaps foursquare can even sponsor mapping
parties in the "empty" areas.  In the end, a free-to-use open geographic
database is what is beneficial to everybody. 

For more information on OpenStreetMap, have a look at its wiki_ or drop by on 
IRC_.
