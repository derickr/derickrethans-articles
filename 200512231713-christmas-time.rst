Yes, christmas time finally gives me some time to write things in my
blog again. In the past month I've been two weeks on holiday in Asia
(more about that later) and another two long weeks on the `eZ components`_ (more
about that in a bit too). In the next few days I'll publish my photos
and experience of Asia and will start on the fourth installment of the `PHP Look Back`_ . Stay tuned!
