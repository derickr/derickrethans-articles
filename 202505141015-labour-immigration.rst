I am disappointed with the way the Labour government is heading.

Instead of trying to improve the country, they seem to be going the far-right
rhetoric way of blaming immigration and ignoring minority rights.

I felt the need to write my MP `Georgia Gould
<https://members.parliament.uk/member/5305/contact>`_ again.

**Subject: Labour's Stance on Immigration: I am neither a stranger, nor the
subject of an experiment**

Dear Georgia Gould MP,

What does the Labour Party stand for? Progressive policies to make this 
country better for its people? Or pandering to far-right Reform-like 
policies that blame all of this country's problems on immigrants, like 
myself?

Yesterday, Kier Starmer proclaimed that people like me, who moved to the 
UK from abroad, did "incalculable damage" to this country.

I had hoped that with Labour coming in after the last election, this 
sort of anti-immigrant rhetoric would be gone. I expected this from the 
Tories, and to a greater extend from Reform, but never from your party.

But I am no longer surprised by it.

I was willing to give Labour the benefit of the doubt, but after nearly 
a year in "power", I haven't seen any positive things that the 
government has done with its large majority.

Your large majority could easily be used to improve our (economic and 
cooperative) relations with the EU, fix the wealth and income imbalances 
by a better (and simpler) tax system with fewer loopholes, or improve 
the rights of minorities, including LGBTQIA+ rights.

Instead, you seem to prefer a miniscule (and pointless) trade deal with 
the US, taking benefits away from disabled people, and shitting on the 
LGBTQIA+ community with this ridiculous stance on who can use which 
toilet.

And now you've come to blame immigrants.

Like myself, and more than half of the population in Brent [1]_, were born 
outside of this country. Are we really the people that do "incalculable 
damage", or rather, was the "incalculable damage" caused by 14 years 
of Tory mismanagement, which your government promised to fix?
 
Are these quotes not really quite the same as Theresa May's nasty 
party's "citizens of nowhere"?

Is this really what the Labour party stands *for*?

I also don't understand what you are trying to achieve with pandering to 
the far-right. You won't win the Reform voters, and you'll end up losing 
support to actual progressive parties like the Greens and the Liberal 
Democrats. Morgan McSweeney's approach is not going to do you any 
favours. If Reform ends up winning the next election, that is going to 
be on *you*.

It also isn't going to help growing the country. You will know that 
immigration is what makes the care system at least sort of work; you will 
know that the building industry can't hire enough labourers to build 
enough houses to meet your housing targets, and you will know that 
economic growth will happen by a comprehensive reset of economic 
relations with the European Union.

As a Dutch-born naturalised citizen of the UK, I will vote against any 
party in Westminster that engages in anti-immigrant or anti-LGBTQIA+ 
rhetoric on principle, before even considering other policy pledges. And 
campaign against ones who do.

I bet am not alone in this.

Yours sincerely,

Derick Rethans
