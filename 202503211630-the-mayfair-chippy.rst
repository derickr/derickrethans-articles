When we arrived, there was a long queue outside waiting to get in. Luckily, my
wife had booked, so we got to skip the queue. Inside, we were seated in a
backroom, with space for about a dozen people. 

The menu isn't extensive, which makes sense, as it's a chippy. We both
therefore had Fish and Chips, but not quite the same ones. My wife had the
cod, while I had the haddock. There wasn't really much between them though.
Both of them came in beautifully light batter. For those who don’t like fish,
or who are vegetarian, they also offer a battered rare breed sausage, or a
battered halloumi as alternatives. 

A reasonable amount of reasonable chips were served with the fish. They were
the classic style of chips you get with a fish and chip supper, a little
chewy, and quite far away from the triple cooked Belgian fries that are so
very good (but not traditional for fish and chips). There were also three
accompaniments: tartare sauce, with crunchy gherkins, mushy peas to cover the
vegetable section, and a nice and spicy curry sauce. My wife being a
traditionalist also went in for the malt vinegar and salt.

With our meal, we shared a bottle of a white Vinho Verde, from Portugal. It's
not something you often find in a chippy, but it was date night after all.

We didn't have any dessert, as the Fish and Chips were quite filling. It's a
good chippy, but I believe it was quite pricey for what it was. You don't
typically pay £25 per person for food at a chippy. Maybe we should try out our
local chippy…

We did come home with a paper party bag of fruit salad sweets and black jacks
though!
