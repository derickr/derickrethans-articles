If you are in search of a bierkeller (German for beer cellar), with a band,
and where you can dance on the tables (but not the benches), then Albert's
Schloss is the place to be.

Luckily for us, there is also upstairs Schenke (think: German bakery café),
and in the cellar there are many tables for less entertaining dining far away
from the band. Here it is quiet enough to have a conversation over burgers,
bratwursts, schnitzels, and other alpine fare. And the accompanying beer.

And this is where we found ourselves on this Friday evening.

Hiding away in the back, next to a ski gondola converted into a dining place,
we started with a half pint of a traditional German beer. My wife chose the
Currywurst as her main, two thick sausages with a spicy sauce and fries. I
selected the Cordon Bleu schnitzel, a flattened chicken breast stuffed with
Gruyère and ham, served with a mushroom sauce and served with Parmesan fries.
The schnitzel wasn't of Austrian proportions — it did actually fit on the
plate — but was well cooked, and certainly enough.

We washed our mains down with another half pint, and as we were quite full, we
decided to have a digestive. You can get schnapps by the dozen, in all kinds
of fruity flavours, but we went for something more classic. My wife had a
Genepi, a slightly fruity grape schnapps, and I enjoyed a Mentzendorff Kümmel,
which had a slight caraway and aniseed flavour to it.

We enjoyed Albert's Schloss, and it was great value. But it's not the place
for a romantic or date-night dinner. Great for a group or a party with friends
though.
