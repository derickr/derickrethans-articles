Back when I just moved to London, now nearly 15 years ago, I would frequent
the Chamberlayne a lot. It was the closest pub with a good food selection, and
the best chips in town.

It has changed hands, and name, a few times in the intervening time, but it's
now back as the Chamberlayne, and we decided to try them out again.

We started with a happy hour, but then of Oysters and not drinks. The
selection included Jersey and Carlingford oysters, as well as the river
oysters Louet Feisser. Oysters have started to grown on me. I wouldn't touch
them a decade ago, but would now happily shuck them myself.

After our starters, I opted for a Grilled Cornish gurnard, a lovely chewy fish
served on a bed of haricot beans with bagna cauda, a garlic and anchovies
purée, and some herbs. I am not usually a fan of beans, but these were nice
and soft and buttery and worked well with the fish and purée.

My wife went for a more traditional choice: a beef burger served with chips.
The burger was well seasoned and moist, with some enjoyable pickles. The chips
were good too, but were not living up to the standard that I remembered from
all these years ago.

They had several ice creams and sorbets for dessert. We were already
reasonably happy, and had a single scoop each. I had a raspberry swirl, and my
wife a salted caramel. Both excellent to finish our meal.

The Chamberlayne had a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere, with good food at
reasonable prices. An excellent local option.
