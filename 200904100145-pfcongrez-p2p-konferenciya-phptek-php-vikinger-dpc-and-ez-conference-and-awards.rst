The above mentioned conferences all have one thing in common: I'll be
speaking. At the first conference, `pfcongrez`_ I will be talking on
implementing Test Driven Development as a model for software
development. A modified version of this talk I will also give at the
next conference, `P2P Конференция`_ (P2P Conference) in Bulgaria. At this same
conference I will be talking on using PHP as development language for
GSM based applications on mobile computing platforms running Linux,
where I will use the `pecl/dbus`_ extension to talk to the
interface framework available on the `OpenMoko`_ platform. This same talk I
will also give at `DPC`_ in
Amsterdam. In between however I will go to Chicago to speak at `php|tek`_ on search technologies in my
"Haystacks and Needles" talk and on simple architecture in my
KISS talk. Before DPC I will also go to Leuven for `PHP Vikinger`_ , an unconference that
I'll be organizing for the 3rd time. This year it is no longer in
Norway, but instead we moved to Leuven in Belgium. It is also de-coupled
from the `eZ Conference and Awards`_ which will be in Paris.
