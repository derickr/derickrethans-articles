Past weekend a bunch of the PHP developers (Zeev, Dmitri, Andrei, Jani,
Wez, Marcus, Rasmus and me) got together in Paris to discuss PHP 6. On
our agenda were Unicode support, the items from Rasmus' wishlist and
many other issues.

I finally had the time to finish the report of the discussions (as you
can see we discussed quite a lot) and publish the `notes`_ .
