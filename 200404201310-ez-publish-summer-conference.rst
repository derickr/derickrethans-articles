On Friday June 4rd and Saturday June 5th, `eZ systems A.S.`_ organizes the second `conference`_ dedicated to `eZ publish`_ , an Open Source CMS. Besides an overview of eZ
publish by BÃ¥rd and case study presentations, `Ken Coar`_ will speak
on an `Apache`_ related
topic and I will speak on a `PHP related topic`_ . If you're interested in Content Managent Systems, or
like a good excuse to come to Norway for a few days, I can highly
recommend attending.
