Over a year ago I `wrote`_ about my
upgraded internet connection. Today I was wondering why I could download
with more than 300kb/sec on a 2 megabit line. It seems that my provider, `XS4All`_ , upgraded the line to 3.2
megabit without telling me. Nice! Now the only sad thing is that this is
the line at my parents place - where I don't usually live :-I
