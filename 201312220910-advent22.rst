Probably one of the easier things to contribute to an Open Source project when
you don't really have much experience, or simply don't know the language well
enoughâ€”or in Xdebug's case, PHP's internals, is documentation. In the past a
few people, such as `Wim Godden`_ and `Jarl Ostensen`_ have already
contributed_ some documentation fixes.

In the last few months I have added support for `serialized "collect
params"`_, `XDEBUG_TRACE_NAKED_FILENAME`_ (issue `#971`_),
`XDEBUG_STACK_NO_DESC`_ (issue `#1003`_), and the `ability to halt on
warning/notice`_ (issue `#1004`_). And neither of those are documented now. So
this article is about adding the documentation of these new features.

Xdebug's documentation is part of the website, which has a project_ on GitHub.
However, it's not in any standard format. Functions are documented in single
files, such as `here for xdebug_start_trace()`_, and in a rather rudimentary
format that some other tools I have use to generate stuff as well. So a bit
tricky, and this is something I'd like to improve, however it's rather easy
to `add to`_.

`Configuration settings`_ are all in `one file`_ and stored as an nested PHP
array. I have now added a new supported value (5) for `xdebug.collect_params`_
which needs documenting too, which is as simple as `adding a new line`_ to it.
Of course, I have also documented_ the changes to
`xdebug_print_function_stack()`_ and the addition of `xdebug.halt_level`_.

Xdebug's documentation is (I think pretty good), but if you have sugggestions
I would be more than happy to get suggestions, or of course even better would
be a pull request.
