Today I went with some friends to visit the Motorschau in Essen,
Germany. On this fair the car manufacturers show their newest
models, and also you can find all kinds of tuning gear. Not exactly
the things I find very intersting, but it's always fun to go
something like this with friends. For photos, see `here`_ .
