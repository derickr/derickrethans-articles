Back in October 2013, Morag and I started walking the London LOOP_ - with
`section 1`_. It took nearly four months before we embarked on the second
section. The delay was mostly caused by the short days and the terrible
weather we have had during the winter. But with the Sun returning and the days
getting longer it was time to do part 2: Bexley to Jubilee County Park. We
originally intended to do the walk on February 15th, but all the trains
towards Kent were buggered due to lots of falling trees caused by the latest
storm — hence our second attempt last Sunday. Why I thought it was a good idea
to do this right after the `PHP UK Conference`_ is a bit of a mystery to me
still.

Of course, the travel to the start of the walk was not as straightforwards as
it could be. With lots of engineering work and bus replacement services. We
ended up taking the train to Barnehurst and bussing it to Bexley—much better
than the route that was suggested by National Rail Inquiries: train from
Charing Cross to Plumstead, bus to Dartford, and then the train *back* to
Bexley.

From Bexley startion we crossed under the railway and headed South. Just
before getting to the river Cray, we walked through some woodland where a fair
amount of trees had not survived the winter storms. Joining the river after a
mile or so we noticed that it was still very high, and rather fast flowing. In
fact, it was so high that many of the paths were either flooded—or very muddy.
The muddy path opened up into the Stable and Footscray Meadows and a very lovely
bridge, the Five Arches, crossing over the river Cray.

I think there was a bit more water in the meadows than there usually was. Or
perhaps the locals tried to create an extra lake. In any case, there was no
dry way out of the meadows into the direction we had to be going. The photo to
the right just points out how much water we had to wade through. I estimate it
was about 3 inches deep.

Past the meadows and All Saints Church we stopped in Sidcup for lunch.
Although the route goes past a pub__, we decided to skip and instead just pick
a cafe in Sidcup itself. But not before we encountered this friendly horse.

Sidcup itself seems like a little village with not much going on, but lunch at 
`Urban Food`_ was decent. After filling up we continued the walk by finding
Sidcup Place and crossing the A20 into Scadbury Park.

`Scadbury Park`_ is rather large and a local nature reserve. It is also old
and has a ruined moated manor in the middle, which was owned by the
Scathebury family. The LOOP as mapped on OpenStreetMap had the route__ go past
the manor, but I found that was incorrect as shown by the sign posts on the
route.

From Scadbury park we crossed into Petts Wood, or rather perhaps it should be
called the Petts Mud Flats as there was nearly no space without mud — some
times up to half a foot deep. An indication of the amount is visible in the
image to the right. I don't think I've ever had this much mud on a walk
actually.

This meant that we were a bit delayed and we would just miss the
train home from `Petts Wood station`_. When coming out of the woods we crossed
multiple sets of train tracks. The section as shown on the left is just
before the end point of second section in the `Jubilee Country Park`_.

The weather was colder than the first section, but that was no surprise as it
is February. At around 8°C there was a fair bit of wind, but we kept it dry.
