After four works of hard work
by my collegues (and only two by me) we finally released `beta2`_ of the `eZ components`_ .
Most of the work was spend on reviewing all components and unifying the
API. As we deem a unified API very important we decided to spend a
little more time on it, and thus we have no final release for
Christmas. The final release of the components is now planned for
January 2006 following RC1 about halfway through that month.

Sandro and Tobias wrote an `article`_ explaining some behind the scenes changes since beta 1. All changes can
be seen in the `ChangeLog`_ .
