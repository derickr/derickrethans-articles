A leap day with a post on Date/Time issues seems fitting...

Earlier today, on twitter_, `@skoop`_ asked: *"dear #lazyweb, when I use
DateTimeZone('GMT'), why does format('e') output UTC?"* What he means is that::

	$date = new DateTime('now', new DateTimeZone('GMT'));
	echo $date->format(DateTime::RFC2822 . ' e' );

which shows::

	Wed, 29 Feb 2012 16:26:23 +0000 UTC

As you can see that has ``UTC`` and not ``GMT`` as you might expect.

If you look closely at the documentation_ for the "Other" group of timezones,
it lists with the ``GMT`` timezone as warning: *"Please do not use any of the
timezones listed here (besides UTC), they only exist for backward compatible
reasons."* If you use ``GMT`` as timezone identifier in the constructor to
``DateTimeZone``, PHP will instead use the correct ``UTC`` in output. When
you create a ``DateTimeZone`` object like this, you will always get a "type 3"
DateTimeZone object::

	$date = new DateTime('now', new DateTimeZone('GMT'));
	var_dump($date);

which shows::

	object(DateTime)#1 (3) {
	  ["date"]=>
	  string(19) "2012-02-29 16:30:51"
	  ["timezone_type"]=>
	  int(3)
	  ["timezone"]=>
	  string(3) "UTC"
	}

Now apparently some systems *\*cough\*Silverlight\*cough\** require ``GMT`` to be
used.  ``GMT`` is **not** a timezone, but just a timezone abbreviation meant
for **output only**.  Read more about that in the article
`"Leap Seconds and What To Do With Them"`_.  However, if it is necessary you
can create a ``DateTime`` object with a different timezone type. In this
case you want a "type 2" timezone associated with the ``DateTime`` object.
You do that by simply forcing that timezone abbreviation when instantiating
a ``DateTime`` object::

	$date = new DateTime('today GMT');
	var_dump( $date );

which shows::

	object(DateTime)#1 (3) {
	  ["date"]=>
	  string(19) "2012-02-29 16:32:16"
	  ["timezone_type"]=>
	  int(2)
	  ["timezone"]=>
	  string(3) "GMT"
	}

Things like this also work::

	$date = new DateTime( "GMT" );
	$date->setDate( 2012, 2, 19 );
	var_dump( $date );

And of course, this is not limited to ``GMT`` only::

	$date = new DateTime( "EST" );
	$date->setDate( 2012, 2, 19 );
	var_dump( $date );

which shows::

	object(DateTime)#1 (3) {
	  ["date"]=>
	  string(19) "2012-02-19 16:37:58"
	  ["timezone_type"]=>
	  int(2)
	  ["timezone"]=>
	  string(3) "EST"
	}


As a reminder of the three different types of timezones that can be attached
to ``DateTime`` objects:

 #. A UTC offset, such as in ``new DateTime( "2012-02-29 -0500" );``
 #. A timezone abbreviation, such as in ``new DateTime( "2012-02-29 EST" );``
 #. A timezone identifier, such as in ``new DateTime( "2012-02-29 America/Montreal" );``

Please also be aware that *only* ``DateTime`` objects with "type 3" timezones
attached to them will calculate correctly over Daylight Saving Time boundaries.
