In this monthly update I explain what happened with Xdebug development in this
past month. These are normally published on the first Tuesday on or after the
5th of each month.

`Patreon <https://www.patreon.com/derickr>`_ and `GitHub
<https://github.com/sponsors/derickr/>`_ supporters will get it earlier,
around the first of each month.

You can `become a patron <https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=7864328>`_ or
support me through `GitHub Sponsors <https://github.com/sponsors/derickr>`_.
I am currently 46% towards my $2,500 per month goal.
If you are leading a team or company, then it is also possible to support
Xdebug through `a subscription <https://xdebug.org/support>`_.

In June, I spend 25 hours on Xdebug, with 25 hours funded.

Development
-----------

Some of the time this month I spend with fixed a few old bugs, and some new
ones with the new return value debugging that I spoke about last month.

This feature allows you to step into the "return value from function" phase,
where PHP returns a value to the caller function. In this step, there will
only be one variable available, which is the return value of that function.

This is now supported with version 1.27 of the PHP Debug Adapter for Visual
Studio Code, if you'd like to try it out.

In this GIF you can see how this is useful with fluent interfaces:

PHP Version Support
-------------------

The other half of my time I spend with adding support for PHP 8.2 for Xdebug
3.2, and dropping support for PHP 7.3 from this same branch. With that, I've
also updated the `version compatibility matrix <https://xdebug.org/docs/compat>`_.

I have also started on removing PHP 7.4 support for Xdebug 3.2 as well, so
that it will only support PHP 8.0 and later. Users of older PHP versions will
still be able to use Xdebug 3.1.

Course
------

I have spend no more time writing actual content for the course, but I have
been collecting subjects to cover. If you have any suggestions of topics that
the course should cover, please get in touch.

Xdebug Cloud
------------

Xdebug Cloud is the *Proxy As A Service* platform to allow for debugging in
more scenarios, where it is hard, or impossible, to have Xdebug make a
connection to the IDE. It is continuing to operate as Beta release.
Packages start at Â£49/month.

If you want to be kept up to date with Xdebug Cloud, please sign up to the
`mailinglist <https://xdebug.cloud/newsletter>`_, which I will use to send out
an update not more than once a month.

Xdebug Videos
-------------

I have published no new videos this month, but
you can find all previous videos on my `YouTube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9Kjjye-m1g_eXpdaifUqLqALLqZqKd4>`_.

Business Supporter Scheme and Funding
-------------------------------------

In June, no new business supporters signed up.

If you, or your company, would also like to support Xdebug, head over to the
`support <https://xdebug.org/support>`_ page!

Besides business support, I also maintain a `Patreon
<https://www.patreon.com/derickr>`_ page, a profile on `GitHub sponsors
<https://github.com/sponsors/derickr>`_, as well as an `OpenCollective
<https://opencollective.com/xdebug>`_ organisation.
