We walked to the Grove Tavern, situated on the corner of a street with a few
other shops, cafés, and another restaurant. When we arrived there were a few
people having a pint, and a few other people eating. We were shown to our
seats in a near-empty part of the dining room.

It being a pub, it does pub food. And it does it rather well.

While waiting for our mains, we first enjoyed some crispy halloumi, dressed in
honey and chilli. They were a little crunchy and sweet. My wife had the Onglet
steak, which she said was better than the steak at Rail House Victoria. It
came with some good chips, a mushroom, and a peppercorn sauce. I enjoyed the
Fish & Chips. It was a good portion with a light, but not whimsical, batter.
Besides it were the usual accompaniments: tartare sauce, chunky chips, and
some mushy peas. The latter I thought were a little too watery.

With our meal, we also shared a bottle of a Paraíso Sur viognier from Chile.

We didn't fancy any of the desserts, and instead we ended up for some dessert
wine at The Brackenbury Wine Rooms at the other side of the terrace. Their
menu looked good too, so that might become a further review.

The Grove was cosy and welcoming, and it fits in well as a neighbourhood pub
with decent food.
