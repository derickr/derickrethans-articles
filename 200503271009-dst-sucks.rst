I don't get why people invented DST (Daylight Savings Time, also called Summer Time). It's quite annoying
and it seems I have to deal with it TWICE in spring this year. That's because I'm currently on my way to
Montréal for the `PHP Québec`_ conference where I will
be talking on Encryption and Data Security.

Already tired from the `Skiing trip to Vrådal`_ of the past few days I
now had to get up an hour earlier than the already early wake up time of 4.30am. Does not make me happy, and
because North America (including Canada) switch to DST *next* week, I'll have an hour less sleep there too.
