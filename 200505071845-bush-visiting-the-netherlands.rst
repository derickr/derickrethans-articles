The "leader" of the Free World is visiting our country to
celebrate the 60th anniversary of the "victory in Europe". And
he's going to do that in Margraten, in the soutern part of the
Netherlands, where a large American 2nd World War cemetary is located. I
wonder why we even allow this guy, who signed a `provisional declaration of war`_ with our country. Our government seems to be
licking the US' ass at as many occasions as possible - which is
interesting as I still think the US' moral values are not even close to
our country 400 years ago, where `torture`_ , `human rights violations`_ and `the death penalty`_ are still not history.

Also, although they call themselves "the Land of the Free",
it's everything except that. With laws like the `Patriot Act`_ and the `intervention of religional values with the courts`_ people are not Free to do
what they want. Another amusing court case is the one where a `13 year old`_ is denied abortion because "she's too young to choose". Things
that I can not understand to be happening in a "free" country.
Sure, I know the Dutch are a bunch of child killing, pot-smoking
hippies, we still know how to have some idea of freedom-to-choose
although our government is trying to get some very disturbing laws
signed about storing `traffic data`_ (information about who you call, whom you send email to and
which web sites you visit).

But back to Bush visiting. There were already some protests `today`_ and more planned for tomorrow. A lot will be made `more secure`_ , including the closure of two highways for a couple of
hours (and not TWO WEEKS like the Americans wanted), abeit at a too high
cost (2-5 million â‚¬). If Bush wants to visit he should pay the bill
too, but it's better if `the man behind the Al Qaida - Iraq link`_ just stays away - we don't want you and your
ideas here!
