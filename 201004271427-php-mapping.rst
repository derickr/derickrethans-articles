About a month ago, `Ordnance Survey`_ opened_ up some of their data for public
consumption under a brand called OpenData_. The data is licenced_ under a
"Creative Commons Attribute"-like license. One of the data sets they provide is
`Code-Point Open`_ and provides a dataset "that contains postcode units, each
of which have a precise geographical location". I've always been a bit of a
map-geek, and have always geotagged my pictures_ and some of my tweets_. So I
was wondering what cool thing I could do with this newly released data.  I
decided to map all the postcodes onto the UK map where more postcodes for a
specific place would create a "lighter" colour. Each postcode has on average
about 15 addresses, so in more densely populated areas you have more
"postcodes-per-area". Doing this wasn't very difficult and it resulted in the
following map:

.. image:: /images/content/postcode-uk-scaled.jpg

You can very clearly see the more densely populated areas such as London.

This generated postcode-density map I wanted to overlay on a real map, such as
OpenStreetMap provides. When I tried to align the image that I generated with
the OSM map, I ended up with this:

.. image:: /images/content/uk-osm-postcode-overlay.jpg

Obviously, the maps don't align. In order to fix this, I ended up learning a
lot more about map projections.

The `Code-Point Open`_ data uses the UK's `National Grid`_ to store location
data in. The National Grid consists of 100*100 km squares that are then further
subdivided into smaller squares creating grid references such as
*TQ3012780512*, or the numerical version *530128 180512*. *TQ* translates into
the "hundred thousands" of the *Eastings* and *Northings* according to the grid
that you can see here__. In this case, it specifies a point 530 128 meters East
and 180 512 meters North of the origin.  (If you work it out, you'll end up in
London).

OpenStreetMap_ uses a Mercator_ projection to visualize maps. The Mercator
projection is a cylindrical map projection, and it distorts the size and shape
of large objects, as the scale increases from the Equator to the poles.
Therefore it only works from about 85°N to 85°S (why it is 85° only be came
clear after doing all the maths for it). Google Maps uses the same projection.

There were a few challenges plotting the `Code-Point Open`_ data on an OpenStreetMap map:

- The National Grid coordinates need to be converted to Latitude/Longitude pairs
- Latitude/Longitude pairs need to be mapped to pixels to align with the
  Mercator projection of OpenStreetMap maps.

For **converting National Grid** references to Latitude/Longitude pairs I found
some `JavaScript code`_. I converted this code to PHP and to verify whether my
code was working properly, I used `this site`__.

**Converting Latitude/Longitude** pairs to the pixel coordinates of OSM
required a bit of maths. OSM provides maps in different zoom levels, from 2__
to 17__. Each zoom level having twice the amount of pixels horizontally and
vertically.  Zoom level 2 has 4 times 4 tiles, where each tile is 256*256
pixels. At zoom level two, the whole world fits into 1024*1024 pixels. The
number of pixels for each axis for a specific zoom-level can be calculated by::

	pow(2^zoom) * 256

For a zoom level of 7 that makes 16384 pixels in each direction. To convert a
longitude (in the range -180° to 180°) we can simply apply::

    x = ((lon + 180) / 360) * (pow(2^zoom) * 256)

For a Longitude of 0.003117° E at zoom-level 13 that turns out to be
pixel 1048594.

Longitude conversions are more difficult due to the Mercator projection itself.
To convert we apply::

    y = ((atanh(sin(deg2rad(-lat))) / π) + 1) * (pow(2^(zoom-1)))

For a Latitude of 51.502817° N at zoom-level 13 that turns out to be
pixel 697399.

Creating an image for the whole world at zoom level 13 is impractical as it is
2097152*2097152 pixels and downloading all the 67 million tiles for this zoom
level is probably not liked by the OSM people either. So instead we take a cut
out for a specific area only. For the UK (61.37°N -9.49° W, 49.76°N +3.63°E) at
zoom level 7 we end up with a 1536x2048 map with the North-Western pixel being
15360,9216. On this map, we can draw the latitudes and longitudes as well as
the National Grid lines (full image is on flickr_):

The only thing left to do now, is to map the postcode density information to
the map. I picked zoom level 6 for this, and the result is (after cropping it
to 640 pixels width):

.. image:: /images/content/uk-osm-postcode.jpg

As you can see, this is perfect fit to the outlines of the country. But
unfortunately, when we look very closely at the plotted map data, for example
for the *NW10 3* postcodes, we notice that the mapping is slightly off. The
blue dots are what we plotted, and the red dots are what the locations
**should** have been:

.. image:: /images/content/uk-osm-nw103-1.png

The reason for this is that when we converted the National Grid locations to
Latitude/Longitude pairs to plot on the OSM maps, I forgot to take into account
the different `Datums`_ that are used in the projections. The Earth is not a
perfect sphere, and an approximation of the ellipsoid of the whole Earth is not
necessarily the best fitting for a specific area such as the UK. Therefore, the
National Grid uses the OSGB36_ Datum which fits more closely to the UK, where
as OpenStreetMap uses the WGS84 Datum that is also used by GPS. The `Ordnance
Survey Ireland`_ has a more thorough explanation_ on their site. As you can see
above, using the wrong Datum can mean locations can be off. In our example
about 100 meters. Converting between different Datums is possible, albeit
processor intensive.

After I figured out all the maths for this, the only problem that remains that
implementing those algorithms in PHP is show—calculating all the
positions from the 1.6 million postcode locations takes up to 10 minutes. This
is why I am not presenting any code yet. I am planning to implement all the
necessary calculations in a `PHP extension`_ to speed up the calculations
