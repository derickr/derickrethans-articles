At the start of 2015 we began work on an HHVM driver for MongoDB, as part
of our project to renew our PHP driver. Back then, HHVM was in its ascendancy
and outperforming PHP 5.6 two to one. With such a huge performance difference
it was reasonable to assume that many users would be switching over. 

Around the start of 2016 I wrote a series_ of blog_ posts_ when
we released the brand new drivers for PHP and HHVM. However, by then, PHP 7.0
had been released. PHP 7's performance is on par with HHVM making it
less useful for users to move from PHP to HHVM. HHVM still offers a more
strongly typed PHP syntax through Hack, and some other features, but its main
attraction, speed, was mostly gone.

Writing an extension for HHVM is very different than doing so for PHP. PHP
extensions, of which there are plenty, are written in C. HHVM extensions are
written in C++, with very few third party extensions existing. At the same
time, although PHP's APIs are not particularly well documented, there is a
large group of people to ask for help. PHP also has a clearly defined internal
API which is stable across minor versions. HHVM does not have this, and APIs
kept changing often, although it wasn't always clear whether we were using an
internal API.

Writing an HHVM extension is a very different experience for extension
developers compared to PHP extensions. There is even less documentation, and
virtually no third party extensions to look at for "inspiration". At the same
time, it was much harder to get help from the developers, and much harder to
debug as HHVM is many times more complex than PHP.

With PHP 7 released, we saw very little use of the HHVM driver for MongoDB.
Some months ago I did a twitter poll, where very few people were indicating
that they were using HHVMâ€”and even if they were, they would likely not choose
to switch to HHVM given the current climate.

Some of the feedback on the poll was not very assuring either:

With few users, frequent API breaks, and `curious bugs`_ we came to the
conclusion that supporting the HHVM driver for MongoDB no longer makes good
use of our engineering time. With `Doctrine`_ and `Symfony 4`_
also no longer supporting HHVM, we have decided to discontinue the MongoDB
driver for HHVM.

If anyone is interested in assuming ownership of the HHVM driver, please drop 
me_ a line and we can discuss the process in more detail.
