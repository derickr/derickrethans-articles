In this monthly update I explain what happened with Xdebug development

`GitHub <https://github.com/sponsors/derickr/>`_ and `Pro/Business supporters
<https://xdebug.org/support>`_ will get it earlier, around the first of each
month.

On GitHub sponsors, I am currently 43% towards my $2,500 per month goal, which
is set to allow continued **maintenance** of Xdebug.

If you are leading a team or company, then it is also possible to
support Xdebug through `a subscription <https://xdebug.org/support>`_.

In the last month, I spend around 10 hours on Xdebug, with 22 hours funded.

Xdebug 3.4
----------

PHP 8.4 was released at the end of November, and with that it was also
necessary to release Xdebug 3.4 with support for it. Before I did that, I had
another good look at many issues to try to find out what the problem was.

I fixed a few issues, and another set of issues disappeared due to `fixes in
PHP itself <https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/16252>`_.

If you find any issues with Xdebug 3.4, then please send me a `bug report
<https://xdebug.org/reporting-bugs>`_ through the `issue tracker
<https://bugs.xdebug.org>`_.

Xdebug Videos
-------------

I have created no new Xdebug videos in the last month, but there is a new
video in my `"Writing Extensions" series <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X44SyxkcFo&list=PLg9Kjjye-m1hW4z0J-546qaFpysjlo27x&index=9>`_.

All Xdebug videos can be watched on my `channel
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9Kjjye-m1g_eXpdaifUqLqALLqZqKd4>`_.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out to
`me on Mastodon <https://phpc.social/@derickr>`_ or via `email
<http://derickrethans/who.html>`_.

Business Supporter Scheme and Funding
-------------------------------------

In the last month, no new business supporters signed up.

Besides business support, I also maintain a `Patreon
<https://www.patreon.com/derickr>`_ page, a profile on `GitHub sponsors
<https://github.com/sponsors/derickr>`_, as well as an `OpenCollective
<https://opencollective.com/xdebug>`_ organisation.

If you want to contribute to specific projects, you can find those on the
`Projects <https://xdebug.org/funding>`_ page.

Xdebug Cloud
------------

`Xdebug Cloud <https://xdebug.cloud>`_ is the *Proxy As A Service* platform to
allow for debugging in more scenarios, where it is hard, or impossible, to
have Xdebug make a connection to the IDE. It is continuing to operate as Beta
release.

Packages start at Â£49/month, and I have recently introduced a package
for larger companies. This has a larger initial set of tokens, and
discounted extra tokens.

If you want to be kept up to date with Xdebug Cloud, please sign up to
the `mailinglist <https://xdebug.cloud/newsletter>`_, which I will use
to send out an update not more than once a month.
