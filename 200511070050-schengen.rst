After my troubels with getting the correct ticket the problems where not
over yet. When I got to Amsterdam I ended up in the non- `Schengen`_ area
of the airport. This doesn't make sense as Norway is part of the
Schengen treaty. The problem with getting from the non-Schengen area
into the Schengen area is a 30 minute queue. Half an hour is a long
time if you only have 55 minutes between flights. The person at the
security check point was as confused as I was, but let me thru withough
much problems. I just made it on the flight to Frankfurt where I'm now
ready to hit the sack.
